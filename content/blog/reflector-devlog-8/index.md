description: "Cleaning Up"

I've taken this first week after the alpha 1 release to reward myself with some code refactoring. I've cleaned up a lot of things that were bothering, and I have few more things that I should finish up this week. Then I'll be putting the colonists to work.

Last weekend I created a <a href="http://roguebasin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RogueBasin</a> page and release announcement for my game. It was a little troublesome (due to some strict automatic spam prevention they have) and I wasn't sure if it would end up being worth it. However, according the analytics provided by itch.io, RogueBasin is my biggest source of traffic after itch.io itself. So you other roguelike devs out there, go and make yourself a RogueBasin page!
