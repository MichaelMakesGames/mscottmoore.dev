June was devoted to the four main remaining parts of the new UI:

- The build menu

- The resources UI

- The jobs UI with drag and drop for changing priority

- And the status UI

For July, I'll start alternating between playtesting and the many smaller UI enhancements in my to-do list, as well as a few bug fixes.
