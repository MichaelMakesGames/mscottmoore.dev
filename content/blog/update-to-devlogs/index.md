description: "Switching to Monthly Updates"

I forgot to post this here. Progress is steady again and I'm working hard on Alpha 2. However, I've decided to switch to more substantial monthly updates instead of weekly devlogs. If you want more frequent updates, I occasionally post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mscottmooredev) and [r/roguelikedev's Sharing Saturday](https://reddit.com/r/roguelikedev). Otherwise, expect an update June 1!
