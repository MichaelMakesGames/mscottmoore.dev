This week I finished up the post-release refactoring I wanted to do. There's always more that could be done, but I'm going to call it there for now.

I've decided that before I start working on the mechanics for alpha 2, I'm going to make some changes to the blog and the itch.io page to better showcase the game. I imagine that will last me the week, but hopefully not beyond.
