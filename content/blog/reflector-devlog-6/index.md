This was a pretty light week, with just a few small UX improvements.

Here's what's new:

- Remember the last direction you were aiming when activated laser
- By default, no longer jump over invalid locations when placing reflectors or buildings
- Show red border when current target location is invalid
- Hold shift to jump over invalid locations
- Added ability to remove single reflector (instead of only having ability to remove all reflectors)
- Added support for moving with numpad
