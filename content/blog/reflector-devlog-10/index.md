This week was devoted to work beyond the game itself. Now with that out of the way, I'm excited to start working on new mechanics and content again, for the first time since mid October!

Here's what I got done this week:

- Added many screenshots to the itch.io page
- Restyled blog to have a dark theme, more fitting the game
- Added an about me page to the blog
- Added a nav bar, with many relevant links, including to the RSS feed
- Added an introduction section the main blog page
